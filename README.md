# Welcome to our Central Codespace Repository

This repository is a collaborative codespace designed to enhance our shared development workflows. Its power extends to every repository you have access to, fostering productivity and innovation.

## ðŸ”’ Security in Codespaces

In GitHub Codespaces, your security and privacy are of paramount importance. Each codespace provides an individual, isolated development environment. These environments are completely separate, and one cannot interact with another.

What sets GitHub Codespaces apart is its robust privacy protections. Even organization administrators, who typically have higher levels of access, cannot peek into or access your personal codespace under any circumstances. This ensures absolute privacy of your work and a secure development environment.

## ðŸ”„ Using this Codespace with Other Repositories

To leverage the capabilities of this codespace with all repositories you have access to, you'll need to generate a personal access token. Here are the steps to do so:

### Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token

1. Navigate to the [token generation page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow,admin:org,write:packages,user,gist,notifications,admin:repo_hook,admin:public_key,admin:enterprise,audit_log,codespace,project,admin:gpg_key,admin:ssh_signing_key&description=GLUEOPS%20-%20Codespaces%20GITHUB_TOKEN) on GitHub.
2. Confirm your password, if prompted.
3. Review the selected scopes for your new token to ensure they align with your needs and permissions.
4. Click the 'Generate token' button at the bottom of the page.

**Note:** Your token is the key to accessing all the repositories you have privileges for. Keep it secure! You won't be able to view it again after navigating away from the page.

### Step 2: Export Your Personal Access Token

After obtaining your personal access token, export it for use in the command line or other environments. Execute the following command in your terminal, replacing `ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your token:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Remember, treat your personal access token like a password. Always keep it secure and never share it with anyone. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸš€
